+1. Using the “**App drawer**” in the top-left of the screen (or the search) – *find* the **“Workflow”** app and *open* it.
+1. *Choose* “**+ Workflow**” in the top-right and you should see the view shown on the screen.
 1. The first thing to do is *choose* **when this Workflow will run** – for the purpose of this exercise we will *choose* the “**On demand**” trigger at the bottom, so it will *only* be executed when you hit **“Run"**.
-1. *Click* "**Add custom log source**"
-1. In the "**Rule name**" field *copy* and *paste* the following:
+
+### 3.2 Querying the failed Order IDs
+Now that we’ve set when this will run, we can start to add in the rest of the logic!
+
+1. *Click* the purple “**+**” icon underneath your trigger and you’ll be presented with the options you see on the screen to add new logical “**tasks.**”
+1. First **“task”** will be to get the **Company** and **StepNames** with issues – so we’ll *choose* the “Execute DQL Query” action which is going to look through the data for these Exceptions within the last 24 hours.
+1. The DQL query itself will look through the data for the “**Exception**” events that get created – it will then return the contextual information that let’s us take some action, for example the **errorType** and **errorMessage** 
+
+```
+fetch bizevents, from:now()-24h
+| filter matchesPhrase(event.type, "Exception")
+| fields json.companyName, json.stepName, json.correlationId, json.errorType, json.errorMessage
 ```
-Vegas Casino Cheat Detection
+
+### 3.3 Formatting the data to send
+
+Our previous step will return the **“raw” data** of the Exceptions that we are facing, but because we want to send this in a **Mattermost channel** – we’ll apply some formatting to make it look nice!
+
+1. Use the purple “**+**” again to *add* another “**task**” and this time *choose* “**Run Javascript**.”
+1. *Copy* over the **JavaScript** from the lab guide into the “**input**” section that’s opened up on the **right-hand side**. 
+
+```JavaScript
+// optional import of sdk modules 
+import { execution } from '@dynatrace-sdk/automation-utils'; 
+
+export default async function ({ execution_id }) { 
+  const yourName = "HAL9000";
+  const dqlStepName = "execute_dql_query_1"; 
+
+  // Fetch DQL result
+  const r = await fetch(`/platform/automation/v1/executions/${execution_id}/tasks/${dqlStepName}/result`); 
+  const body = await r.json(); 
+  const events = body["records"]; 
+
+  // Build Mattermost message
+  let niceOutput = `:rotating_light: **[${yourName}] Exception Events Detected (Last 24h)** :rotating_light:\n`;
+
+  events.forEach((event, index) => {
+    niceOutput += `\n---\n:hash: **Event #${index + 1}**\n`
+                + `&#127970; **Company**: \`${event['json.companyName']}\`\n`
+                + `:gear: **Step**: \`${event['json.stepName']}\`\n`
+                + `:link: **Correlation ID**: \`${event['json.correlationId']}\`\n`
+                + `:boom: **Error Type**: \`${event['json.errorType']}\`\n`
+                + `:speech_balloon: **Message**: _${event['json.errorMessage']}_\n`;
+  });
+
+  return niceOutput;
+}
 ```
-1. Change "**Log source type**" under "**Custom log source path**" to "**Log Path**"
-1. At the bottom, *click* "**Add custom log source path**"
-1. In the path field, *copy* and *paste* the following:
+
+3. Near the top is a section titled “**Enter your details here!**” which has 2 values.
+     - Enter “**your name**”. (either your actual name or something slightly humorous) *This will be used at the start of the message we send to Mattermost – in a real scenario, this could be a point of contact should anyone have questions about the message.*
+     - *Enter* name of the “**task**” (or step) of the DQL we just added.  *If you didn’t change the name of that step leave it as-is, otherwise change it to the name that you have used.*
+
+At a high-level what this **code** is *doing* is firstly *getting* the **results** of the **DQL** from the previous step, then creating a **nicely formatted message for Mattermost** where each Order is listed out on a new line (and includes emojis!).
+
+### 3.4 Sending the orders to a Mattermost channel
+
+The last step now is to *send* the **message** we’ve just created into the Mattermost channel. To make this possible we first need to create a “**URL**” that we can *send* the **messages** to via **API**.
+
+1. Open up the **ACE-box dashboard** and *select* the “**Links**” tab – there is a “**Mattermost**” row here and this will give you the URL and **credentials** to be able to *login*.
+2. Once you’ve logged in, *click* the **icon** with four square in the **top-left** of the interface and choose **Integrations** > **Incoming Webhooks**. 
+3. *Choose* to “**Add Incoming Webhook**” a new webhook, and *give* it a **title** 
+4. *Set* the channel to “**Town Square**”
+5. *Hit* “**Save**,” and make a *copy* of the **URL** that it provides.
+6. In Dynatrace, head to the "**Settings Classic**" app and navigate to "**Preferences**" > "**Limit outbound connections.**"
+7. Choose the option to "**Add item**" and add in the "**domain**" part of the URL from Mattermost.
+8. - The end value should only have "mattermost.xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx.dynatrace.training"
+8. Back in your Workflow, *Click* the purple “**+**” to add a new “**task**”
+9. *Choose* the “**HTTP Request**" task
+10. *Change* the request type to "**POST**"
+11. For the "**URL**" box enter the URL that was just generated in Mattermost.
+12. For the **payload** of the request, *enter* the **value below** so that it will send in the message we created in the JavaScript step:
+
 ```

+{
+  "text": "{{result("run_javascript_1") }}"
